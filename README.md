## Prerequisites

For running this script you'll need:
* Python
* An IDE
* Speech Recognition Module
* PyAudio Module
* PiP Installer
* An active internet connection *as Google API needs internet to function*

## Installing

If you have Python up and running all you need to do is download the external modules from the PiP Installer, just type:
```pip install SpeechRecognition```
